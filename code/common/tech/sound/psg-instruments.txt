PSG Instruments are stored directly in Z80 RAM, along with the sound driver, so here are the offsets from the Z80 point of view :

0x12B2..0x12D2		Pointer table of PSG Instruments
0x12D2..0x135F		PSG Instruments


PSG Instruments only affect the output level. 

They are composed of two parts : 
- The attack part : it is used at the beginning of a new note
- The release part : it is used when the note is released

For each part, the data is a series of 0x bytes ended by an 8x byte.
At each "sound frame", the next byte is parsed, and the output level of the channel is the result of (instrument total level - F + x)
When the 8x byte is reached, it keeps using that same x value until the note is released or until a new note is played.

EXAMPLE : 

Lets say that Instrument A has been loaded with total level C.

Here is the data of Instrument A :

RAM:133E                 db  0Bh                attack frame 0 level : C - F + B = 8
RAM:133F                 db  0Dh		attack frame 1 level : A
RAM:1340                 db  0Fh		attack frame 2 level : C
RAM:1341                 db  0Eh		B
RAM:1342                 db  0Dh		A
RAM:1343                 db  8Ch ; î		9, and stay at 9 until note is released (equivalent to sustain level)
RAM:1344                 db  0Ah		release frame 0 level : 7
RAM:1345                 db  0Ah		7
RAM:1346                 db    9		6
RAM:1347                 db    9		6
RAM:1348                 db  88h ; ê		5, and stay at 5 until a new note is played

You'll notice that with this instrument, if the total level is not low enough, releasing the note will not stop it, but just make it lower.
